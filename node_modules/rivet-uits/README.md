# Rivet
Rivet is a design system for use in UITS web application development projects. At its core Rivet is a well-documented set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets. It was design to be used on interactive web applications with a focus on user experience best practices and accessibility.

**NOTE**:

This is a read-only repository containing the compiled assets for Rivet. Please create any issues here on the Rivet source repository:

## Whatâ€™s if for?
Rivet is not a replacement for the IU Web Framework which should be used for static content-driven brochure websites. Rivet is meant to be used for internal-facing enterprise level applications. If you are looking to build a departmental, or organizational website you should use the [IU Web Framework](https://framework.iu.edu/) and [IU Web Style Guide](https://styleguide.iu.edu/).
